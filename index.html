        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m a 20-year-old computer science undergraduate currently in my second year at the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) in Sri Lanka. My academic journey is enriched by IIT’s strong affiliation with the University of Westminster, which provides a global perspective and a robust curriculum. </p>
        <p>As a passionate and dedicated student, I am constantly exploring the vast field of computer science, from coding and software development to data analysis and artificial intelligence. My coursework and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. </p>  
        <p> Outside of academics, I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends, participating in hackathons, and collaborating on innovative projects with my peers. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my career. </p>
        <p> Feel free to connect with me to discuss tech, share ideas, or collaborate on exciting projects!...</p>
